# 2.5D Raycaster Demo (SDL3)

###### Copyright Â© 2024 Elijah Day

### About

This is another attempt at a 2.5D raycasting program.  This time, it's
implemented in SDL3.

There are some improvements from my last attempt.  Though, they aren't many.
Unfortunately, the "fisheye lens" perspective is still present as I didn't have
much time to delve into the math behind fixing it.

It's not the best code, but there's still some aspects of it that may be worth
referencing later on.
